This is a very simple Google Earth server that reads in an NGA ephemeris
file for GPS satellites and plots a 12 hour chunk of their orbit on
Google Earth. Just point this program at an ephemeris file, fire up google 
earth, point it at the included demo.kml file and watch the orbits
pop up! You can also point Google Earth at the included sample kml,
which is a dump of the KML file through netcat, with the http server
headers removed.

The NGA doesn't publish current ephemeris or predicted ephemeris. The files
usually seem to start 2 days behind current, so I just take the current
time, subtract 2 days and then use that as the range to plot the orbit.
If there aren't any points available for that time in the file you use,
well, bummer!

You can find the NGA ephemeris files on their web site at 
http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/sathtml/PEexe.html. If you're
not using an OS that can run an exe file, you can decompress those
files with lharc. Just go 'lha e file.exe'. Nevermind how long it
took me to figure THAT out...

You'll need gcc 4.7 or some other c++11 compiler to compile this, as
one of the reasons I wrote it was to play with some of their new
features. Compiling this will require my coordinates, time and data
libraries, also available on github.

If you look at the demo code, it really wouldn't be difficult to
plot the satellite as a point at a specific time. The only down side to 
doing that is you can't push updates to Google Earth. You can only tell
the KML file to refresh on a regular basis. If you do it, say, once per
second, you can watch the satellite fly in real time, but all your points
in the sidebar will flash every time it updates. Which is kind of annoying.
You can separate the orbit and satellite point servers -- as far as I know
there's no actual limit to the number of network links you can have. This
helps a bit, because at least the orbits don't have to be recalculated every
second, but it's still somewhat annoying.

There are a lot of other refinements that can be made here; you could set
up the server so you don't have to recalculate the orbits every time
you get a connection, for example. It'd be very easy to set the styles
in the ge_objects and publish the styles in the orbit server, in order
to color code each orbit to make it easier to tell the satellites apart.
This code is mostly here to demonstrate my coordinates library and is
mostly cobbled together with brute force and ignorance (BFI!)
